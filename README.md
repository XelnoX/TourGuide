# TourGuide
This is an Android application for those who, need a good tour around the city they stay in.

## The structure of the application
If you start the application, first you will see the login screen. From there you can navigate to the registration or the forgot password screen. If you log in to the application, you will see all of the routes that are available.

You can filter the routes by giving specific informations about where, do you want to take a tour and approximately what is the minumum and maximum time and distance you willing to sacrifice. You can view the route details, where you can see all of the informations about it. If you find a good route that you want to take, you can select it. After selected a route, you will be navigated to the map screen where you can see the points that will be touched. Unfortunately I couldn't implement the directions google API for navigation, because it wouldn't be free.

You can edit your profile data, the optional properties can be changed easily, but for the main stuff you must add your current password.
